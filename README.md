CRM for running a local Scout Group

Scout Master is design to allow a local Group Leader, Group Council and Group Committee to easly manage a Scout Group.

Scout Master is NOT a tool to publish a web site you can use the likes of Drupal to do that.

Scout Master is squarely focused on management activities within a Scout Group.

We need your help in making ScoutMaster great.

Check out the sites wiki at https://github.com/bsutton/scoutmaster/wiki for details on the technology we use and how you can get involved.

The aim of version one of Scout Master is the following:

Version 1.0

Create events and invite participants to those events.

Track youth member badge progress
